Instead, the query can make use of a number of different options, which are specified in the URL string itself. Each option is assigned a value with an equals sign, for example 'family=Pineceae'; these are placed after a question mark '?' at the end of the endpoint URL, which signals a 'query string' will follow. Multiple query options are separated by an ampersand '&' in the URL string.\n",

    "* **taxonTypeCode**, a four-letter that indicates which NEON taxonomy is being queried, such as FISH or BIRD\n",
    "* One of the major taxonomic ranks from genus through kingdom\n",
    "* **scientificName** a specific name of format genus + specific epithet + (authority); this is used to search for an exact result\n",

    "* **verbose** takes a 'true' for a more detailed response or 'false' for a shorter response\n",
    "* **offset** takes an integer indicating the number of starting rows of the list of results to skip; the default is 0\n",
