## Learning Objectives 
After completing this tutorial you will be able to: 

* Download and navigate NEON's electrofishing data
* Get the data you need with the `select()` and `filter()` funtions from the 
  dplyr package


## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

### R Programming Language
You will need a current version of R to complete this tutorial. We also recommend 
the RStudio IDE to work with R.

### The `dplyr` Package
You will need a basic understanding of dplyr, especially the piping operator, 
`%>%`. This can be found in our tutorial <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/grepl-filter-piping-dplyr-r">here</a>.

### R Packages to Install
Prior to starting the tutorial ensure that the following packages are installed. 
* **neonUtilites:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`
* **dplyr:** `install.packages("dplyr")`
* **ggplot2:** `install.packages("ggplot2")`

## Getting Started

Load required packages to your R session.

```{r library-packages}
library(dplyr)
library(neonUtilities)
library(ggplot2)
```

First we need to download the data we want to work with. For simplicity let's look at the most recent electrofishing bout available at the time this was written: Fall 2019.

```{r load-data }
electrofishing_fall2019 <- loadByProduct(dpID = "DP1.20107.001",
                                         startdate = "2019-07",
                                         enddate = "2019-12",
                                         package = "expanded",
                                         check.size = FALSE)
```

If you want, you can omit the `check.size = FALSE` argument. If you do, 
`loadByProduct` will check the size of the data you want to download and ask your 
permission to proceed.

Let's take a look at our data!
```{r structure}
class(electrofishing_fall2019) # loadByProduct() produces a named list
names(electrofishing_fall2019) # view the names of the items of that list
```

The `electrofishing_fall2019` object is a list of 8 tables, plus the readme file. We can reference these by using the `$` operator (eg. `electrofishing_fall2019$fsh_bulkCount`) to 
look at each table, but this is cumbersome. To save ourselves some typing, we can 
list each of the tables to our global environment so we can call them directly. R 
has a built-in function for this: `list2env()`.

```{r list-to-environment}
list2env(electrofishing_fall2019, .GlobalEnv)
```

Your environment panel should now contain an entry for each table in 
`electrofishing_fall2019`. Now we can call `fsh_bulkCount`, etc. directly.

## Counting Species

Let's start by getting a handle on what we're working with. The `fsh_perFish` 
table lists all of the fish NEON collected individual data for. If there are too 
many individuals of a single taxon for NEON technicians to measure efficiently, 
the first 50 individuals are processed, and the rest are counted in bulk. This 
information is included in the fsh_bulkCount table.

When dealing with a new dataset, it can be useful to `View()` the variables table 
(named `variables_20107` for this data product), which describeds the variables 
reported in the various tables contained within the download. RStudio will open 
this in a new tab.

Since we're counting just the number of species collected, we can use the 
`fsh_perFish` table to get the information that we need. We can select the column 
we want, `scientificName`, with the `select()` function, and remove any duplicate 
species names using the `distinct()` function. `summarize(n())` returns a count of
resulting vector of unique scientific names.

```{r total-species-1}
fsh_perFish %>%
     select(scientificName) %>%
     distinct(scientificName) %>%
     summarise(n())
```

If you wish, you can view the list of species by replacing `summarise(n())` with `View()`.

It is important to keep in mind that many of these species are difficult to 
identify in the field. Information regarding uncertainty of the ID is recorded in 
the `identificationQualifier` variable. If an individual couldn't be IDed to 
species level, the most specific taxon possible was recorded. The variable 
`taxonRank` contains this information.

Let's see how many species we have that were IDed to species level with no qualifiers regarding that ID. We can do this by piping our data through two `filter()` functions.

```{r total-species-2}
fsh_perFish %>%
        filter(is.na(identificationQualifier)) %>%     # make sure identificationQualifier is 'NA'
        filter(taxonRank == "species") %>%             # NEVER USE `variable == NA` for this
        select(scientificName) %>%                     # `is.na(variable)` is much more reliable
        distinct(scientificName) %>%
        summarise(n())       # NOTE: filters on these columns must be run before
                             # select() removes those columns from our data
```

## Grouping by Site and Graphing

Now let's see how many species were found at each site. We'll run the same code 
as before and store it to a variable, but this time we'll include the `siteID` 
variable and run `group_by(siteID)` so the `summarise()` function will find a 
count for each site individually. 

```{r richness-by-site}
richness_by_site <- fsh_perFish %>%
        filter(is.na(identificationQualifier)) %>%
        filter(taxonRank == "species") %>%
        select(siteID, scientificName) %>%
        group_by(siteID) %>%                # groups by site
        distinct(scientificName) %>%
        summarise(num_species = n()) %>%
        arrange(-num_species)               # puts rows in decreasing order
```

Now we can make a graph with ggplot!

```{r richness-by-site-graph}
ggplot(richness_by_site, aes(x = siteID, y = num_species)) +
        geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
        scale_x_discrete(limits = richness_by_site$siteID) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 2)) +
        labs(
                title = "Total Species Richness by Site",
                x = "Site ID",
                y = "Number of Species"
        )
```

Looks like <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/MAYF">Mayfield Creek</a> in Domain 8 has far and away the
highest species richness, but to get a deeper understanding of Mayfield Creek's 
fish populations we'll need an idea of relative and absolute abundance. Since 
NEON uses a three-pass electrofishing method, we will need to do a bit of 
processing to get the quantities we need.

The next tutorial in the series, *Relative and Absolute Fish Population Abundance Estimation*
will cover processing the Mayfield Creek data to 
obtain catch per unit effort (CPUE) to determine relative abundance of our species. We will also use a function from the FSA package 
designed to estimate absolute abundance via a three-pass depletion method. Lastly 
we will automate the process for each species in each reach (without writing any 
`for` loops!)
