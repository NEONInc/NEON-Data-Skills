## Spatial Metadata
There are three core spatial metadata elements that are crucial to understand
in order to effectively work with spatial data:

* **Coordinate Reference System** (CRS)
* **Extent**
* **Resolution**

## Coordinate Reference System
The Coordinate Reference System, or CRS, tells R where the raster is located in 
geographic space. It also tells R what method should be used to "flatten" or 
project the raster in geographic space. 
 
It is important when working with spatial data in a program like R to identify 
the coordinate reference system applied to the data and retain it throughout data 
processing and analysis.  Otherwise, data from the same location but saved in 
different projections will not line up in any GIS or other program.

## Spatial Extent
The spatial extent of a spatial object is simply how much area does it cover. For 
example, a map of Paris has a smaller spatial extent than a map of all of France.  

### Units
The units of the extent are defined by the coordinate system that the spatial
data is in. A UTM coordinate system is in meters, for example. Geographic coordinate 
reference systems are in latitude and longitude, which is most often recorded in 
decimal degrees.

### Extent in Vector Data

    alt=”The three types of vectors (points, lines, and polygons) are represented 
    within the given (8,8) spatial extent.”></a>
    <figcaption>The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents 
    the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south, east, 
    and west. Thus it represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

The spatial extent of a vector dataset is determined by the min and max “X,Y” 
location of **all** the spatial objects stored in the dataset. The spatial extent 
of an **individual** object can also be quantified!

Let’s look at the spatial extent of a line shapefile representing roads at the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

``` {r vector-extent, fig.cap="Roads at NEON Harvard Forest field site with longitude and latitude labeled on the axes"}
#load libraries
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2) #used to plot the vector shapefile

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where 
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the unzipped download into your working directory! 
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd)

# import a line shapefile
lines_HARV <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV"), "HARV_roads")

# plot vector shapefile with long and lat on axes
lines_HARV_df <- fortify(lines_HARV)

ggplot() +
  geom_path(data=lines_HARV_df, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
  labs(title = "HARV Roads")

# view crs
crs(lines_HARV)

# view extent
extent(lines_HARV)

```

The CRS is critical to interpreting the object extent values as it specifies 
units. In this case the units are in meters.

Learn more about vector data extent and other attributes in the NEON Data Skills Lesson<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/dc-shapefile-attributes-r" target="_blank"> *Explore Shapefile Attributes & Plot Shapefile Objects by Attribute Value in R*</a>.

### Extent in Raster Data
The spatial extent of a raster represents the "X,Y" coordinates of the corners
of the raster in geographic space. This information, in addition to the cell
size or spatial resolution, tells the program how to place or render each pixel
in 2 dimensional space.  Tools like `R`, using supporting packages such as
`rgdal`, and associated raster tools have functions that allow you to view and
define the extent of a new raster.

``` {r raster-extent, fig.cap="Digital surface model showing continuous elevation of NEON Harvard Forest field site with UTM meters labeled on the x- and y-axes"}
# load raster
DSM_HARV <- raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif"))

# plot raster
plot(DSM_HARV, main="Digital Surface Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

# view crs to determine units
crs(DSM_HARV)

# view the extent of the raster
extent(DSM_HARV)
```

<figure>
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/raster_streched_extent.png">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/raster_streched_extent.png"
    alt="The image on the left has an extent of (0,8,0,8) and is less blurry than the image on the right which is stretched to an extent of (0,16,0,16)."></a>
    <figcaption>If you double the extent value of a raster - the pixels will be
    stretched over the larger area making it look more "blury".
    </figcaption>
</figure>

### Calculating Raster Extent
To calculate the extent of a raster, we first need the bottom left "X,Y"
coordinate of the raster. In the case of the UTM coordinate system which is in 
meters, to calculate the raster's extent, we can add the number of columns and 
rows to the "X,Y" corner coordinate location of the raster, multiplied by the 
resolution (the pixel size) of the raster.

Let's explore that next, using a blank raster that we create.

``` {r calculate-raster-extent, fig.cap="16 raster cells in various colors plotted between -180 and 180 on the x-axis and -90 and 90 on the y-axis"}
# create a "blank" raster from the matrix
myRaster1 <- raster(nrow=4, ncol=4)

# assign data to the raster
myRaster1[]<- 1:ncell(myRaster1)

# view attributes of the raster
myRaster1

# is the CRS defined?
crs(myRaster1)

# what are the data extents?
extent(myRaster1)
plot(myRaster1, main="Raster with 16 pixels")

```
You will notice the CRS is defined on this new raster. These are the default values 
for something created with the `raster()` function if nothing is defined.

## Spatial Resolution
A raster consists of a series of pixels, each with the same dimensions
and shape. In the case of rasters derived from airborne sensors, each pixel
represents an area of space on the Earth's surface. The size of the area on the
surface that each pixel covers is known as the spatial resolution of the image.
For instance, an image that has a 1 m spatial resolution means that each pixel in
the image represents a 1 m x 1 m area.

    alt=”A grid made up of 5 rows and 6 columns where each one meter by one meter 
    cell is a different shade of blue.”></a>
    <figcaption>The spatial resolution of a raster refers the size of each cell
    in meters. This size in turn relates to the area on the ground that the pixel
    represents.</figcaption>
</figure>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/dev-aten/graphics/raster-general/raster_multiple_resolutions.png"
    alt=”Four rasters with the same (8,8) extent. The image on the left is the 
    most blurry with a resolution of 8 meters. The images get more “crisp” with 
    4 and 2 meter resolutions and the highest resolution, 1 meter, is the most 
    “crisp” image on the right.”></a>
    <figcaption>A raster at the same extent with more pixels will have a higher
    resolution (it looks more "crisp"). A raster that is stretched over the same
    extent with fewer pixels will look more blurry and will be of lower resolution.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Let's open up the `DSM_HARV` raster from above to see the attributes including extent 
and resolution.

``` {r raster-attributes}
# view raster attributes
DSM_HARV

```

Notice that this raster (in GeoTIFF format) has defined:

* extent
* resolution (1 in both x and y directions), and
* CRS (units in meters)
