## Geographic vs Projected CRS

In the previous tutorial, we explored two different types of Coordinate Reference
Systems:

1. **Geographic coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that span the entire
globe (e.g. latitude / longitude)
2. **Projected coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that are localized to
minimize visual distortion in a particular region (e.g. Robinson, UTM, State Plane)

In this tutorial, we will discuss the differences between these CRSs in more
detail.


## Geographic Coordinate Systems

A geographic coordinate system uses a grid that wraps around the entire globe.
This means that each point on the globe is defined using the SAME coordinate system. Geographic coordinate systems are best for global analysis however it
is important to remember that distance is distorted using a geographic lat / long
`CRS`.

The **geographic WGS84 lat/long** `CRS` has an origin - (0,0) -
located at the intersection of the
Equator (0° latitude) and Prime Meridian (0° longitude) on the globe.

NOTE: The code for this map can be found in the .R document that is available for 
download at the bottom of this page!

```{r, geographic-WGS84, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.cap="World map plotted on an X, Y grid with the axes labeled "longitude" and "latitude" and untis in degrees. The origin (0,0) is at the center of the plot."}

#load libraries
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where 
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the unzipped download into your working directory! 
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd)

# read shapefile
worldBound <- readOGR(dsn=paste0(wd,"ne_110m_land"),
                      layer="ne_110m_land")

# convert to dataframe
worldBound_df <- fortify(worldBound)

# read grat shapefile
worldGrat30 <- readOGR(dsn=paste0(wd,"ne_110m_graticules_all"),
                      layer="ne_110m_graticules_30")

# convert to dataframe
worldGrat30_df <- fortify(worldGrat30)

#import box
wgs84Box <- readOGR(dsn=paste0(wd,"ne_110m_graticules_all"),
                    layer="ne_110m_wgs84_bounding_box")

wgs84Box_df<- fortify(wgs84Box)

#plot map
ggplot(wgs84Box_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill="white") +
  xlab("Longitude (Degrees)") + ylab("Latitude (Degrees)") +
  ggtitle("World Map - Geographic WGS84 (lat/lon)") +
  geom_polygon(data=worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group))+
  geom_path(data=worldGrat30_df, aes(long, lat, group=group, fill=NULL), linetype="dashed", color="grey50") +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "white"), guide="none")
```



<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** The distance between the 2 degrees of 
longitude at the equator (0°) is ~ 69 miles. The distance between 2 degrees of 
longitude at 40°N (or S) is only 53 miles. This difference demonstrates how measures 
of distance when using a geographic lat / long `CRS` are not uniform.


## Projected Coordinate Reference Systems


Spatial projection refers to the mathematical calculations
performed to flatten the 3D data onto a 2D plane (our computer screen
or a paper map). Projecting data from a round surface onto a flat surface, results
in visual modifications to the data when plotted on a map. Some areas are stretched
and some some are compressed. We can see this when we look at a map of the entire
globe.


The mathematical calculations used in spatial projections are designed to
optimize the relative size and shape of a particular region on the globe.

### About UTM

The **Universal Transverse Mercator** (UTM) system is a commonly used projected
coordinate reference system. UTM subdivides the globe into zones,
numbered 0-60 (equivalent to longitude) and regions (north and south).

UTM zones are also defined using bands, lettered C-X (equivalent to latitude). 
However, the latitude band designation is often dropped as it isn't esssential to 
specifying the location.

The figure below shows the full UTM zone notation including latitude bands. Rather 
than using "N" or "S" to denote the Northern or Southern hemisphere, the latitude 
bands are divided so that letters before "M" in the alphabet are south of the equator 
and, conveniently, letters after "N" are north.

A full **grid zone** reference combines the zone and latitude band for a point. 
The zone is written first, followed by the latitude band ("17T" for example).

</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  The UTM system doesn't apply to polar
regions (>80°S or >84°N). The Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) coordinate system is
used in these areas. This is where zones A, B and Y, Z are used if you were
wondering why they weren't in the UTM lettering system. 

While UTM zones span the entire globe, UTM uses a regional projection and
associated coordinate system to reduce distortion across a large north-south 
extent. The coordinate system grid for each zone is projected individually using 
the **Mercator projection**.

The spatial coordinates (easting and northing) for each UTM zone are defined by 
their position relative to the equator and central meridian for that zone. In the 
Northern Hemisphere, the northing values start at zero at the equator and increase 
northward. To avoid negative easting values, the central meridian for each zone is 
defined as 500,000 meters East. 

Remember, UTM zone distortion errors increase with distance away from the central 
meridian, so values that are hundreds of kilometers away from 500,000m easting are 
likely to have substantial distortion. For example, because the (0,0) point is 
outside of the boundary of a UTM zone, the actual on-the-Earth location that corresponds 
to (0,0) in one zone may be more precisely described in the next UTM zone to the West. 

The take-home point is that UTM zone coordinates should always be positive, and 
you are likely to be working with numbers in the hundreds of thousands of meters 
easting and possibly in the millions of meters northing!

### Understanding UTM Coordinates

Let's look at the coordinates for the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site. The UTM coordinates 
are typically written as:

UTM Zone 18N, 730782m, 4712631m

Note that the N denotes this point is in the Northern, not Southern, hemisphere. 
Occassionally, you may see the grid zone notation written as: 

Zone 18T, 730782m Easting, 4712631m Northing

In both cases, the easting and northing coordinate pair is the distance in meters 
from the (0,0) point of Zone 18. This can become quite confusing when refering to 
Zone '18S' which usually refers to UTM Zone 18 South (in the Southern Hemisphere),
or may also refer to UTM Zone 18S (in the Northern Hemisphere between Zones 18R 
and 18T). Be sure to reality check your coordinates when in doubt!

### Datum

The datum describes the vertical and horizontal reference point of the coordinate
system. The vertical datum describes the relationship between a specific ellipsoid
(the top of the earth's surface) and the center of the earth. The datum also describes
the origin (0,0) of a coordinate system.

Frequently encountered datums:

* *WGS84* -- World Geodetic System (created in) 1984.  The origin is the center of
the earth.
* *NAD27* & *NAD83* -- North American Datum 1927 and 1983,
respectively.  The origin for NAD 27 is Meades Ranch in Kansas.
* *ED50* -- European Datum 1950

For more information, check out
*  <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/Datums/003r00000008000000/" target="_blank">ESRI's ArcGIS discussion of Datums.</a>
*  <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf" target="_blank">page 2 in M. Fraiser's CRS Overview.</a>


Note that all coordinate reference systems have a vertical and horizontal datum
which defines a "0, 0" reference point. There are two models used to define
the datum (we will not cover these concepts in this tutorial): 
* **ellipsoid** (or spheroid): a mathematical representation of the shape of
the earth. Visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article on the earth ellipsoid </a>for more information. 
* **geoid**: a model of the earth's gravitational field which approximates the mean 
sea level across the entire earth.  Elevation is measured from this. Visit 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" target="_blank">Wikipedia's geoid
article </a>for more information.



### Coordinate Reference System Formats

There are numerous formats that are used to document a **CRS**. In the next tutorial
we will discuss three of the commonly encountered formats including: **Proj4**,
**WKT** (Well Known Text), and **EPSG**.
