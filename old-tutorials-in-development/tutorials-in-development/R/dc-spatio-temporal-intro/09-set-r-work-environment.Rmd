## About
Add description.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Goals / Objectives

After completing this activity, you will:

*
* Understand that different spatial data types & associated file types require
different tools to work with them.

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Lesson
To complete this lesson you will need the most current version of R, and
preferably, RStudio loaded on your computer.

### Install R Packages

* **NAME:** `install.packages("NAME")`

* [More on Packages in R - Adapted from Software Carpentry.]({{site.baseurl}/R/Packages-In-R/)

### Download Data
EDIT AS NEEDED

<h3> <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3701578"> NEON Teaching Data Subset: Airborne Remote Sensing Data </a></h3>

The LiDAR and imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset 
were collected over the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank"> National Ecological Observatory Network's</a> 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/HARV" target="_blank" >Harvard Forest</a>
and 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/field-sites/field-sites-map/SJER" target="_blank" >San Joaquin Experimental Range</a>
field sites and processed at NEON headquarters. 
The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> NEON Data Portal</a>.

****

**Set Working Directory:** This lesson assumes that you have set your working 
directory to the location of the downloaded and unzipped data subsets. 

<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/set-working-directory-r" target="_blank"> An overview
of setting the working directory in R can be found here.</a>

**R Script & Challenge Code:** NEON data lessons often contain challenges that reinforce 
learned skills. If available, the code for challenge solutions is found in the
downloadable R script of the entire lesson, available in the footer of each lesson page.


**Spatial-Temporal Data & Data Management Lesson Series:** This lesson is part
of a lesson series introducing
[spatial data and data management in `R` ](https://www.neonscience.org/tutorial/URL).
It is also part of a larger
[spatio-temporal Data Carpentry Workshop ](https://www.neonscience.org/workshops/spatio-temporal-workshop)
that includes working with  
[raster data in `R` ](https://www.neonscience.org/tutorial/spatial-raster-series),
[vector data in `R` ](https://www.neonscience.org/tutorial/spatial-vector-series)
and  
[tabular time series in `R` ](https://www.neonscience.org/tutorial/tabular-time-series).
