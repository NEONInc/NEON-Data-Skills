### Coordinate Reference System review

We learned that a coordinate reference system is used to define the location of 
something. This system consists of an X and a Y value located within a 2 (or more) 
-dimensional space.

	<figcaption> We use coordinate systems with X, Y (and sometimes Z axes) to

</figure>

We also explored two different types of Coordinate Reference Systems: 
**Geographic coordinate systems** and **Projected coordinate systems**.

In this tutorial, we will cover the ways `CRS` information is stored.


## Coordinate Reference System formats

There are many different Coordinate Reference Systems and they are each defined 
by a set of parameters. There are many formats that are used to document those 
parameters. Three common formats include:

* **PROJ4**
* **EPSG**
* **WKT** (Well-known Text)  

We will explore each of these formats below.


## PROJ or PROJ4 strings

PROJ4 strings are a compact way to identify a spatial or coordinate reference
system. PROJ4 strings are the primary output from most of the spatial data `R`
packages that we will use (e.g. `raster`, `rgdal`).

Using the PROJ4 syntax, we specify the complete set of parameters including 
projection, ellipse, datum, and units that define a particular CRS.


### Understanding CRS in PROJ4 format
The `CRS` for our data are given to us by `R` in PROJ4 format. Let's break
down the pieces of a PROJ4 string. The string contains all of the individual
`CRS` elements that `R` or another `GIS` might need. Each element is specified
with a `+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by
a `,`. After each `+` we see the `CRS` element being defined. For example
`+proj=` and `+datum=`.


### UTM PROJ4 String

Let’s look at a `PROJ4` string for a projected coordinate system, UTM.

```{r utm-string }

#load libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import and where 
# we want to save our files. Be sure to move the unzipped download into your working directory! 
wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd)

# read shapefile
point_HARV <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/HARV/HARVtower_UTM18N.shp"))

# view proj4 CRS string
crs(point_HARV)

```

Our string for `point_HARV` specifies the UTM projection as follows:`

* **+proj=utm:** the projection is UTM, UTM has several zones.
* **+zone=18:** the zone is 18
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the 0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **+units=m:** the units for the coordinates are in METERS.
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's roundness is calculated) for
the data is WGS84

Note that the `zone` is unique to the UTM projection. Not all `CRS` will have a
zone.


### Geographic (lat / long) PROJ4 String

Next, we’ll explore the `PROJ4` string for a geographic (lat/long) coordinate system.

```{r geographic-string}
# read shapefile
State_boundary <- readOGR(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Site-Layout-Files/US-Boundary-Layers/Boundary-US-State-Mass.shp"))

# view proj4 CRS string
crs(State_boundary)
 
```


Our string for `State_boundary` specifies the lat/long projection as follows:

* **+proj=longlat:** the data are in a geographic (latitude and longitude)
coordinate system
* **datum=WGS84:** the datum WGS84 (the datum refers to the  0,0 reference for
the coordinate system used in the projection)
* **+ellps=WGS84:** the ellipsoid (how the earth's roundness is calculated)
is WGS84

Note that there are no specified units above. This is because this geographic
coordinate reference system is in latitude and longitude which is most
often recorded in *Decimal Degrees*.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** the last portion of each `PROJ4` string
is `+towgs84=0,0,0 `. This is a conversion factor that is used if a `datum`
conversion is required. We will not deal with datums in this particular series.


## EPSG codes
The EPSG codes are a structured dataset of `CRS`s that are used around the world. They were
originally compiled by the, now defunct, European Petroleum Survey Group, hence the
EPSG acronym. Each code is a four or five digit number.  
 
<a href="http://spatialreference.org/" target="_blank">Spatialreference.org</a> is 
a great tool to look up `CRS` strings using an EPSG code. Use the search to find 
an EPSG code and the associated `CRS` of interest. You will then see the various 
formats associated with that `CRS`.

The codes and more information can be found on these websites:
* <a href="http://www.epsg-registry.org/" target="_blank">The EPSG registry</a>
* <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">Spatial Reference's list of EPSG codes</a>

You can also create a list of EPSG codes using the` make_epsg()` function in 
the `rgdal` package in `R`. This can be useful if you need to look up a code 
without using <a href="http://spatialreference.org/" target="_blank">Spatialreference.org</a>.

``` {r EPSGcode-list}

# create data frame of EPSG codes
epsg = make_EPSG()

# View first rows of the data frame
head(epsg)
```

Once you have a `data.frame` of EPSG definitions, you can search for a specific 
code. Let’s search for 4326 to see what `CRS` it represents. We will use `dplyr` 
pipes and the `filter()` function to quickly extract the row we want. Notice that 
a double = sign (`==`) specifies equals to.

``` {r code-search}
# load library
library(dplyr)

# search and view proj4 string for the EPSG code 4326
epsg %>%
  filter(code == 4326)
```

Alternatively, you can search for geographic coordinate systems by searching 
for `longlat` in the `prj4` column of the data frame. Use the `str_detect()` 
from the `stringr` package in your pipe to find all `CRS` definitions that contain 
the string `longlat`.

``` {r longlat-search}
# load library
library(stringr)

# search for longlat
longlat <- epsg %>%
  filter(str_detect(prj4, 'longlat'))

# view first rows from search
head(longlat)
```

Search for UTM projections the same way. 

```{r utm-search}

utm <- epsg %>%
  filter(str_detect(prj4, 'utm'))

head(utm)
```


## WKT or Well-known Text

Well-known Text (WKT) allows for compact machine- and human-readable representation 
of geometric objects. It concisely describes the critical elements of `CRS` 
definitions using a combination of elements separated by commas (,) and brackets 
([]). Elements are described in all caps. 

Below is an example of WKT for the `CRS` information in EPSG code 4326:
 
``` {r WKT, eval=F, purl=F}

GEOGCS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["WGS_1984",
        SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
    UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]]
```

The WKT format tends to be the easiest to understand because the CRS information 
is more transparent. It can also be more difficult to read and compare than PROJ4 
strings. Many tools, including ESRI’s ArcMap and ENVI, use the WKT format.

More information on WKT can be found in the <a href="http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html#36" target="_blank">Open Geospatial Consortium WKT document</a>.
