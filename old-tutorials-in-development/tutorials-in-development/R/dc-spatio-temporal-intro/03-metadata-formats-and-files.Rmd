</div>

```{r elevation-map, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of raster data with a color scale in unknown units."}
library(raster)
# render DSM for lesson content background
DSM_HARV <- raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")

# code output here - DEM rendered on the screen
plot(DSM_HARV,
      main="A Dataset You Are Given\n What metric does it represent?\nHow Was It Processed??")

```


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: What Do I Know About My Data?

The figure above was created from a dataset that you are given called:
`HARV_dsmCrop.tif`.

* What other information would you like to know about the data
used to create the above map before you would feel comfortable using this data
to address a research question?
* Think about the data used to create this plot. If you had to share this data
with a colleague, what information do they need to know, to efficiently work
with it?

How does thinking about this plot and what you'd like to know about it influence
how you think about sharing data with a colleague?

</div>

```{r challenge-know-the-data, echo=FALSE}

# Everything! We have no idea what this raster represents (what metric),
# what the units are, what the scale represents, when it was collected, etc.
# When we create data it needs to be documented sufficiently (and efficiently)
# for sharing with others.

```

## Why Do We Need Metadata?

Looking at the map above, we are missing information needed to begin working
with the data effectively, including:

**Spatial Information**

* **Spatial Extent:** What area does this dataset cover?
* **Coordinate reference system:** What spatial projection / coordinate reference
system is used to store the data? Will it line up with other data?
* **Resolution:** The data appears to be in **raster** format. This means it is
composed of pixels. What area on the ground does each pixel cover - i.e. What is
its spatial resolution?

**Data Collection / Processing Methods**

* **When was the data collected?** Is it recent or historical?
* **How was this data generated?** Is this an output from a model, is it an image
from a remote sensing instrument such as a satellite (e.g. Landsat) or collected
from an airplane? How were the data collected?
* **Units:** We can see a scale bar of values to the right of the data, however,
what metric and in what units does this represent? Temperature? Elevation? Precipitation?
* **How were the data processed?**

**Contact Information**

* **Who created this data?**
* **Who do we contact:** We might need permission to use it, have questions
about the data, or need more information to give correct attribution.

When we are given a dataset, or when we download it online, we do not know
anything about it without proper documentation. This documentation is called
**metadata** - data about the data.

## What are Metadata?
Metadata are structured information that describes a dataset. Metadata include
a suite of information about the data including:

* Contact information,
* Spatial attributes including: extent, coordinate reference system, resolution,
* Data collection & processing methods,
* and much more.

Without sufficient documentation, it is difficult for us to work with external
data - data that we did not collect ourselves.

### Why Are Metadata Needed?

We need metadata to work with external data. When metadata are embedded
in a file or in provided in a machine readable format, we can access it directly
in tools like `R` or `Python` to support automated workflows. We will talk about
different metadata formats, next.


## Metadata Formats

Metadata come in different formats. We will discuss three of those in this
tutorial:

* **Structured Embedded Metadata:** Some file formats supported embedded
metadata which you can access from a tool like `R` or `Python` directly from the
imported data (e.g. **GeoTIFF** and **HDF5**). This data is contained in the same
file (or file set as for shapefiles) as the data.
* **Structured Metadata Files:** Structured metadata files, such as the
Ecological Metadata Language (**EML**), are stored in a machine readable format
which means they can be accessed using a tool like `R` or `Python`. These files
must be shared with and accompany the separate data files. There are
different file formats and standards so it's important to understand that
standards will vary.
* **Unstructured Metadata Files:** This broad group includes text files,
web pages and other documentation that does not follow a particular standard or
format, but documents key attributes required to work with the data.

Structured metadata formats are ideal if you can find them because they are most
often:

* In a standard, documented format that others use.
* Are machine readable which means you can use them in scripts and algorithms.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:** When you find metadata for a dataset
that you are working with, **DOWNLOAD AND SAVE IT** immediately to the directory
on your computer where you saved the data. It is also a good idea to document
the URL where you found the metadata and the data in a "readme" text file that
is also stored with the data!


## Embedded Metadata - GeoTIFF

If we want to automate workflows, it's ideal for key metadata required to
process our data to be embedded directly in our data files. The **GeoTIFF**
(`fileName.tif`) is one common spatio-temporal format that can store
**metadata** directly in the `.tif` file itself.

### What is a GeoTIFF??

A **GeoTIFF** file stores metadata or attributes about the file as embedded
`tif tags`. A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` image format with additional spatial
(georeferencing) information embedded in the file as tags. These tags can
include the following raster metadata:

1. A Coordinate Reference System (`crs()`)
2. Spatial Extent (`extent()`)
3. Values for when no data is provided (NoData Value)
4. The resolution of the data

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:**  Your camera uses embedded tags to store
information about pictures that you take including the camera make and model,
and the time the image was taken.

More about the  `.tif` format:

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF" target="_blank"> GeoTIFF on Wikipedia</a>
* <a href="https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/" target="_blank"> OSGEO TIFF documentation</a>


The `raster` package in `R` allows us to directly access `.tif tags`
programmatically. We can quickly view the spatial **extent**,
**coordinate reference system** and **resolution** of the data.

NOTE: not all geotiffs contain tif tags!

Next, let's explore the metadata associated with  a **Digital Surface Model** created
using LiDAR data for the NEON Harvard Forest field site.


The code below provides an example of how we can access spatial metadata
in `R`. We cover this in more detail in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/series/introduction-working-raster-data-r" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working With Raster Data in R*</a> tutorial.


```{r load-libraries }

# load libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import 
# and where we want to save our files. Be sure to move the download into 
# your working directory! 

wd <- "~/Documents/data/" #This will depend on your local environment 
setwd(wd) 

# read in a GeoTIFF raster file (.tif) using the raster() function
DSM_HARV <- raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif"))

# view Coordinate Reference System (note, this often contains horizontal units!)
crs(DSM_HARV)

```

### Spatial Classes in R

There are specific classes designed to store some of the spatial metadata
associated with spatial data in R. Let's have a look.


```{r crs-class}
# assign crs to an object (class) to use for reprojection and other tasks
myCRS <- crs(DSM_HARV)
myCRS

# what class is the new CRS object?
class(myCRS)

# view spatial extent
extent(DSM_HARV)

# view spatial resolution
res(DSM_HARV)

```

The spatial `extent()` is a class as well. Let's have a look.

```{r view-extent}

# view object extent
myExtent <- extent(DSM_HARV)
myExtent
class(myExtent)

# print object name to return object metadata & attribute data

DSM_HARV
```


We can use embedded metadata to programmatically perform processing tasks
on our data including reprojections, cropping and more.


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge - Explore GeoTiff Metadata

Open the file `NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif`. This
file is a Canopy Height Model (CHM) for the Harvard Forest Field site.

1. Create an **extent** and a **crs** object from the file.
2. Is the extent and CRS of the CHM different from the extent and CRS of the DSM
that we just opened above?
3. Now, open the file `NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/005_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif`.
Compare the extent and crs to the CHM and DSM. Are they different?

</div>

```{r challenge-extent, echo=FALSE}

# 1. they should create both objects
CHM.HARV <- raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif"))
crs(CHM.HARV)
extent(CHM.HARV)

# 2. the extent and CRS should be the same
# 3. The extent and CRS are different.
ndvi1.HARV <- raster(paste0(wd,"NEON-DS-Landsat-NDVI/HARV/2011/ndvi/005_HARV_ndvi_crop.tif"))
crs(ndvi1.HARV)
extent(ndvi1.HARV)
```

It appears as if there are some differences between the objects **extent** and
**crs**. What does this mean for us as we work with these data in the coming
tutorials? HINT: we will find out!


We will work with embedded metadata in both the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/vector-data-series" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working With Vector Data in R*</a> 
and the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/series/introduction-working-raster-data-r" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working With Raster Data in R*</a> series!

## Embedded Metadata - Hierarchical Data Formats (HDF5)

HDF5 is another file type that supports embedded metadata format. Check out the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/intro-hdf5-r-series" target="_blank">*Introduction to Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5)*</a> series to learn more about how HDF5 stores metadata.

## Structured Metadata - EML

The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a data specification developed
specifically to document ecological data. An EML file is created using a `XML` 
based format.

This means that content is embedded within hierarchical tags. For example
the title of a dataset might be embedded in a `<title>` tag as follows:

	 <title>Fisher Meteorological Station at Harvard Forest since 2001</title>

Similarly, the creator of a dataset is also be found in a hierarchical tag
structure.

    <creator>
      <individualName>
        <givenName>Emery</givenName>
        <surName>Boose</surName>
      </individualName>
    </creator>



## EML Terminology

Let's first discuss some basic **EML** terminology. In the
context of EML, a file documents a **dataset**. This dataset may consist of one
or more files that are documented in the EML document. In the case of our
tabular meteorology data, the structure of our EML file includes:

1. The **dataset**: A dataset may contain one or more data tables associated
with it that may contain different types of related information. This
Harvard meteorological dataset contains data tables with the measurements
collected at the tower.
2. The **data tables**: Data tables refer to the actual data that make up the
dataset. For the Harvard dataset, each data table contains a suite of
meteorological metrics including precipitation and temperature (and associated
quality flags) that are aggregated at a particular time interval (e.g. one data
table contains monthly average data, another contains 15 minute averaged data,
etc)


## Work With EML in R

The `EML` package for `R` is designed to open, read and create EML formatted
metadata. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how we can use EML
structured metadata in an automated workflow.

NOTE: To save time, we will not explicitly teach the `EML` package. But we will provide an example of how you can access EML metadata programmatically using the `EML` package.


```{r install-EML-package, results="hide", warning=FALSE }
# install EML package
install.packages("EML")

# load EML package
library("EML")

# load ggmap and tmaptools for mapping
library("ggmap")
library("tmaptools")

```

Next, we will read in the Harvard Forest LTER `EML` file directly from the
online URL using the `read_eml()` function. This file describes multiple data
products that are available for download on the
<a href="https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF001" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest Data Archive Page </a>for the Fisher Meteorological Station.

Note that because this EML file is large, it takes quite a few seconds for the file to
load.


```{r read-eml, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# import EML from Harvard Forest Met Data
eml_HARV <- read_eml("http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/data/eml/hf001.xml")

# view size of object
object.size(eml_HARV)

# view the object class
class(eml_HARV)

```

The `read_eml()` function creates an `EML` class object. This object can be
accessed using `slots` in `R` (`$`) rather than a typical subset `[ ]` approach.

## Explore Metadata Attributes

We can begin to explore the contents of our EML file and associated data that it
describes. Let's start at the **dataset** level. We can use `slots` to view
the contact information for the dataset and a description of the methods.

```{r view-eml-content }
# view the contact name listed in the file
eml_HARV$dataset$creator

# view information about the methods used to collect the data as described in EML
eml_HARV$dataset$methods

```


## Identify & Map Data Location

Looking at the coverage for our data, there is only one unique x and y value.
This suggests that our data were collected at one point (x, y) location. We
know this is data from a tower so a point location makes sense. Let's grab the
x and y coordinates and create a quick context map. We will use `ggmap` to create our map.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Note:**  If this were a rectangular extent
(e.g. from a raster, line or polygon object) we'd want the bounding box, not
just a point within the extent. We need the extent to properly geolocate and
process the data.


```{r map-location, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='Map of Massachusetts, U.S.A., showing location of Harvard Forest'}

# grab x coordinate from the coverage information
XCoord <- eml_HARV$dataset$coverage$geographicCoverage$boundingCoordinates$westBoundingCoordinate

# grab y coordinate from the coverage information
YCoord <- eml_HARV$dataset$coverage$geographicCoverage$boundingCoordinates$northBoundingCoordinate
  
# make a map with the x and y coordinates
ggmap(get_stamenmap(rbind(as.numeric(paste(geocode_OSM("Massachusetts")$bbox))), 
                    zoom = 11, maptype=c("toner")), extent=TRUE) + geom_point(aes(x=as.numeric(XCoord),y=as.numeric(YCoord)), 
             color="darkred", size=6, pch=18)

```

The above example demonstrates how we can extract information from an `EML`
document and use it programmatically in `R`! This is just the beginning of what
we can do!

## Unstructured Metadata - Web pages & Text Files

Some metadata are stored in a less or non-structured format such as a web page
or a text file.

Let's visit the
<a href="https://harvardforest1.fas.harvard.edu/exist/apps/datasets/showData.html?id=HF001" target="_blank"> Harvard Forest Fisher Tower webpage</a>
to explore some unstructured metadata.

Visiting this page, we see a list of data files available for Harvard Forest
that can be downloaded directly. Hovering over the files with our mouse, we can
see that these are .csv tabular text files.

Scroll down to the **Overview** section. Here we start to see information that
can be considered metadata about the data available for download.


<div id="challenge" markdown="1">

## Challenge - Explore Unstructured Metadata

Explore the metadata stored on the Harvard Forest LTER web page. Answer the
following questions.

1. What is the time span of the data available for this site?
2. You have some questions about these data. Who is the lead investigator / who
do you contact for more information? And how do you contact them?
3. Where is this field site located? How is the site location information stored
in the metadata? Is there any information that may be useful to you viewing the
location? (HINT: what if you were not familiar with Harvard as a site or are
from another country, etc?)
4. Field Site Information: What is the elevation for the site? What is the
dominant vegetation cover for the site? HINT: Is dominant vegetation easy to
find in the metadata?
5. How is snow dealt with in the precipitation data?
6. Are there some metadata attributes that might be useful to access in a script
in `R` or `Python` rather than viewed on a web page?

HINT: Can you answer all of the questions above from the information provided
on this website? Is there information that you might prefer to find on that page?
</div>

```{r challenge-code-metadata, echo=FALSE}
# Metadata Notes from hf001_10-15-m_Metadata.txt
# 1. 2001-2019
# 2. Emery Boos - located at the top of the document, email is available
# 3. a lat long is available in the metadata at the top, we see the location 
# described as Prospect Hill Tract (Harvard Forest).
# 4. 342 m elevation, the veg type is not clear in the metadata
# 5. Found in the methods: Delayed melting of snow and ice (caused by problems with rain gage heater or heavy precipitation) is noted in log - daily values are corrected if necessary but 15-minute values are not. The gauge may underestimate actual precipitation under windy or cold conditions.
# 6. this could be a discussion. things like units, time zone, etc are all useful
# if accessed programmatically

```

NOTE: This data and metadata are used in the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/tabular-time-series" target="_blank">*Introduction to Working With Time Series Data in Text Formats in R*</a> series.


## Unstructured vs. Structured Metadata

Metadata are particularly important when we are working with data that we did
not collect ourselves. When you download, or gain access to data from a
colleague, or other data provider, be sure to first find and review the
metadata. Then, if the data is in a separate file (e.g., structured or
unstructured metadata) make sure you save the metadata in a directory that is
closely associated with wherever you save the data itself!


## Create Metadata For Your Data

When you are creating data that you want to share with others, it is critical
to create your own metadata. While this is beyond the scope of this tutorial,
There are many resources available to support metadata documentation including:

* <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/morpho" target="_blank"> **Morpho**</a>:
an open-source program that can be used to enter metadataa to be stored in a
file that conforms to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) specifications.

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
### Challenge: Find & Explore Metadata

Refer back to the list of possible data sources at the end of
[*Answer a Spatio-temporal Research Question with Data: Where to Start?*](https://www.neonscience.org/R/spatio-temporal-research-questions#resources-for-locating-spatial-and-ecological-data).
Choose a site that is relevant to your interests and then find a dataset. For
this dataset find the metadata and answer the following questions:

1. What format are the metadata in?
2. What metric is collected? Does it have units? If so, what?
3. Who collected the data? Using what type of instruments?

</div>

## ATBD vs Metadata

An Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) is a document which describes the
collection and processing methods associated with a data product. While these
documents are beyond the scope of this tutorial, it is important to note that
often important information about your data may be documented in documents
such as ATBDs.

* <a href="http://data.neonscience.org/documents" target="_blank">NEON</a>
provides ATBDs for all of it's data products.
