Data storage and management have important implications for scientific 
reproducibility. This tutorial covers one possible workflow for managing 
NEON data downloads reproducibly, using a community-developed R package, 
**neonstore**.

NEON data are initially published as provisional, i.e. subject to change. 
Data in the provisional state may be re-processed and re-published on an 
as-needed basis, usually due to data quality procedures. Beginning in 2021, 
an annual static Release of NEON data will be published, containing most or 
all NEON data up to a data-specific provisional lag time. Data in a 
Release will be associated with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and will 
not change throughout the lifetime of the observatory.

For more information about Data Releases and NEON's data processing 
pipelines, see the <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data-management" target="_blank">Data Management</a> pages on the NEON website, and the data 
pipeline videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NEONBetaEDU" target="_blank">NEON Science YouTube page</a>.

Since NEON data may change over time, either between Releases or during the 
provisional period, it's wise to keep the original data files used in a 
particular analysis or paper, in addition to any subsequent updated versions 
of those data files. The neonstore package offers a smooth, straightforward 
way to do this, and handles the file organization for you.

In this tutorial, we'll download data from three data products, examine the 
file structure neonstore places them in, and use the neonUtilities package to 
extract and stack a subset of data from each data product.

## Objectives
After completing this activity, you will be able to:

 * Download and manage NEON data using the neonstore package 
 * Extract and stack data from your neonstore archive 

## Things Youâ€™ll Need To Complete This Tutorial
You will need a version of R (3.4.1 or higher) and, preferably, `RStudio` 
loaded on your computer to complete this tutorial.

### Install R Packages

* **neonstore**: `install.packages("neonstore")`
* **neonUtilities:** `install.packages("neonUtilities")`

## Additional Resources

* NEON <a href="http://data.neonscience.org" target="_blank"> Data Portal </a>
* <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/code-hub" target="_blank">NEON Code Hub</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/cboettig/neonstore" target="_blank">neonstore on GitHub</a>

## Set Up R and Local Storage Location

First install and load the necessary packages.

```{r setup}

# install packages. can skip this step if already installed
install.packages("neonstore")
install.packages("neonUtilities")

# load packages
library(neonstore)
library(neonUtilities)

```

By default, neonstore will choose a directory to save the downloaded 
data. You can see where this is by checking the `neon_dir()` 
setting:

``` {r check-dir}

neon_dir()

```

Optional: Set the environment variable `NEONSTORE_HOME` to override 
the default directory and specify a file location you want to use 
to store your NEON data files.

``` {r set-dir}

# set to the file path you want to use
Sys.setenv(NEONSTORE_HOME = "~/data/neonstore")

```

You can also `NEONSTORE_HOME` as a permanent environment variable, to 
avoid having to set it each time you use it. For instructions on setting 
a permanent environment variable, see the final section in the 
<a href="https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial" target="_blank">API Token Tutorial</a>.

## Download Data

Let's imagine we're attempting to predict ecosystem carbon fluxes based 
on plant community composition and climate. We'll need to download three 
data products: Bundled eddy covariance (DP4.00200.001), Plant presence 
and percent cover (DP1.10058.001), and Single-aspirated air temperature 
(DP1.00002.001).

For simplicity, let's assume we're interested in only 2019 data, and only 3 
sites, spanning a large latitudinal gradient: Toolik Lake (TOOL), Wind River 
(WREF), and Guanica (GUAN).

Download the data for each data product and site using the neonstore function 
`neon_download()`:

```{r download, eval=F, results="hide"}

neon_download(product="DP4.00200.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="basic",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

neon_download(product="DP1.00002.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="basic",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

neon_download(product="DP1.10058.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="expanded",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

```

Let's take a look at the file structure created for these data. 
Here the folders are expanded to see the Toolik data folders, 
and the data folder is opened for the eddy covariance data from 
May 2019.

</figure>

There is a folder for each data product, with subfolders for each site, 
and sub-subfolders for each month, which contain the data files.

We just downloaded the currently available data, which are the most 
recent. Remember that one of our goals here is to retain traceable files 
even when data are updated. If you attempt to re-download the same data 
immediately, neon_download() will detect that the available files match 
the files you already have, and decline to download again:

```{r download, eval=F}

neon_download(product="DP1.10058.001", 
              start_date="2019-01-01",
              end_date="2020-01-01",
              type="expanded",
              site=c("TOOL","WREF","GUAN"))

```

What would happen if files had been updated between the two downloads? We 
can't try that out in real time, because files are updated only 
occasionally, but here is an example folder containing multiple downloads 
of updated data:

<figure>
	<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/neonstore-stackFromStore/updated-files.png">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NEONScience/NEON-Data-Skills/main/graphics/neonstore-stackFromStore/updated-files.png" alt="Folder containing multiple files with differing publication dates."></a>
</figure>

You can see there are two copies of each file. The final 16-character 
string in each file name, before the file extension, is a publication 
time stamp in the form YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ. In this example, the first set of 
files were published on October 19, 2020, and the second set on November 
30, 2020. neonstore retains both.
