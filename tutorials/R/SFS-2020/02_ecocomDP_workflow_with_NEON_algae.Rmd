## Introduction
In this second live coding section of the workshop, we will explore how to find and download NEON biodiversity data using the ecocomDP package for R, which is under development by the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI).

#### What is ecocomDP?
ecocomDP is both the name of an R package and a data model. 
 
EDI describes the ecocomDP data model as "A dataset design pattern for ecological community data to facilitate synthesis and reuse". 
 
See the ecocomDP github repo here:
<a href="https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP ">https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP</a>.

The motivation is for both NEON biodiversity data products and EDI data packages, including data from the US Long Term Ecological Research Network and Macrosystems Biology projects, to be discoverable through a single data search tool, and to be delivered in a standard format. Our objective here is to demonstrate how the workflow will work with NEON biodiversity data packages. 

This tutorial was prepared for the <a href="https://freshwater-science.org/sfs-summer-science"> Society for Freshwater Science 2020 "Summer of Science" </a> program.

## Load Libraries and Prepare Workspace
First, we will load all necessary libraries into our R environment. If you have not already installed these libraries, please see the 'R Packages to Install' section above. We load the `devtools` package here so that we can install the latest development version of the ecocomDP package from Dr. Sokol's GitHub repository. The ecocomDP package is not yet available through CRAN, and therefore, we must install the package in this manner.

There are also two optional sections in this code chunk: clearing your environment, and loading your NEON API token. Clearning out your environment will erase _all_ of the variables and data that are currently loaded in your R session. This is a good practice for many reasons, but only do this if you are completely sure that you won't be losing any important information! Secondly, your NEON API token will allow you increased download speeds, and helps NEON __anonymously__ track data usage statistics, which helps us optimize our data delivery platforms, and informs our monthly and annual reporting to our funding agency, the National Science Foundation. Please consider signing up for a NEON data user account, and using your token <a href="https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial">as described in this tutorial here</a>.

```{r load libraries, eval=F, comment=NA}

# clean out workspace

#rm(list = ls()) # OPTIONAL - clear out your environment
#gc()            # Uncomment these lines if desired

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(devtools)
library(vegan)

# install neon_demo branch of ecocomDP
devtools::install_github("sokole/ecocomDP@neon_demo")

library(ecocomDP)

# source .r file with my NEON_TOKEN
# source("my_neon_token.R") # OPTIONAL - load NEON token
# See: https://www.neonscience.org/neon-api-tokens-tutorial

```

```{r load libraries-hidden, include = FALSE, purl = FALSE}

## This code chunk is hidden and will only be ran 
# during the knitting process

# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(neonUtilities)
library(devtools)
library(ecocomDP)
library(vegan)

```

## Download Macroinvertibrate Data
In this first step, we show how to search the ecocomDP database for macroinvertibrate data including those from LTER and NEON sites (and others).
```{r download-macroinvert}

# search for invertebrate data products
my_search_result <- 
    ecocomDP::search_data(text = "invertebrate")
View(my_search_result)

# pull data for the NEON aquatic "Macroinvertebrate
# collection" data product
# function not yet compatible with "token" argument 
# in updated neonUtilities
my_search_result_data <- 
    ecocomDP::read_data(id = "DP1.20120.001",
                        site = c("ARIK", "POSE"))

```

Now that we have downloaded the data, let's take a look at tht `ecocomDP` data object structure:

```{r view-ecocomDP-str}

# examine the structure of the data object that is returned
my_search_result_data %>% names()
my_search_result_data$DP1.20120.001 %>% names()
my_search_result_data$DP1.20120.001$tables %>% names()
my_search_result_data$DP1.20120.001$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_search_result_data$DP1.20120.001$tables$observation %>% head()

```


## Search ecocomDP

We can even search for terms in the ecocomDP database using regular expressions:

```{r search-ecocomDP}

# search for data sets with periphyton or algae
# regex works!
my_search_result <- ecocomDP::search_data(text = "periphyt|algae")
View(my_search_result)

```

Let's download the data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" from "ARIK" and view its structure:

```{r download-plankton}

# pull data for the NEON "Periphyton, seston, and phytoplankton collection" 
# data product
my_search_result_data <- 
    ecocomDP::read_data(id = "DP1.20166.001", site = "ARIK")


# Explore the structure of the returned data object
my_search_result_data %>% names()
my_search_result_data[[1]] %>% names()
my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables %>% names()


my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$location
my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$taxon %>% head()
my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$observation %>% head()

# This data product has algal densities reported for both
# lakes and streams, so densities could be standardized
# either to volume collected or area sampled. 

# Verify that only benthic algae standardized to area 
# are returned in this data pull:
my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$observation$unit %>%
    unique()


```

## Join Observation and Taxon info

Next, we join the observation and taxon information so that we can see the full taxonomic information, rather than just the taxon_id, for each sampling event:

```{r join-obs-taxon}

# join observations with taxon info
alg_observations_with_taxa <- my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$observation %>%
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%
  left_join(my_search_result_data[[1]]$tables$taxon) %>%
  select(-authority_taxon_id) %>%
  distinct()

alg_observations_with_taxa %>% head()

```

We can also make a quick plot to see which taxon rank (i.e., what level of taxonomic specificity was achieved by the expert taxonomist) is most common:

```{r plot-taxon-rank}

# which taxon rank is most common
alg_observations_with_taxa %>%
  ggplot(aes(taxon_rank)) +
  geom_bar()

```

## Species Accumulation Curve
Next, we will plot the species accumulation curve for these samples. To do so, we will first need to convert the density data from m2 to cm2, and make the data 'wide':

```{r SAC-1}

# convert densities from per m2 to per cm2
alg_dens_long <- alg_observations_with_taxa %>%
  mutate(dens_cm2 = (value / 10000)) %>%
  filter(taxon_rank == "species") %>%
  select(event_id, taxon_id, dens_cm2)

# make data wide
alg_dens_wide <- alg_dens_long %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = taxon_id, 
              values_from = dens_cm2,
              values_fill = list(dens_cm2 = 0),
              values_fn = list(dens_cm2 = mean)) %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames("event_id")
  
# Calculate and plot species accumulcation curve for the 11 sampling events
# The CIs are based on random permutations of observed samples
alg_spec_accum_result <- alg_dens_wide %>% vegan::specaccum(., "random")
plot(alg_spec_accum_result)

```

## Compare Observed and Simulated species accumulation curves

```{r compare-obs-sim-SAC}

# Extract the resampling data used in the above algorithm
spec_resamp_data <- data.frame(
  data_set = "observed", 
  sampling_effort = rep(1:nrow(alg_spec_accum_result$perm), 
                        each = ncol(alg_spec_accum_result$perm)),
  richness = c(t(alg_spec_accum_result$perm)))


# Fit species accumulation model
spec_accum_mod_1 <- alg_dens_wide %>% vegan::fitspecaccum(model = "arrh")


# create a "predicted" data set from the model to extrapolate out 
# beyond the number of samples collected
sim_spec_data <- data.frame()
for(i in 1:25){
  d_tmp <- data.frame(
    data_set = "predicted",
    sampling_effort = i,
    richness = predict(spec_accum_mod_1, newdata = i))
  
  sim_spec_data <- sim_spec_data %>%
    bind_rows(d_tmp)
}


# plot the "observed" and "simulated" curves with 95% CIs
data_plot <- spec_resamp_data %>% bind_rows(sim_spec_data) 

# Note that the stat_summary function, as used here, requires
# the Hmisc package to be installed, though you do not need
# to load Hmisc using the 'library()' funciton
data_plot %>%
  ggplot(aes(sampling_effort, richness, 
             color = as.factor(data_set),
             fill = as.factor(data_set),
             linetype = as.factor(data_set))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = median_hilow, fun.args = list(conf.int = .95), 
               geom = "ribbon", alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = median_hilow, geom = "line", 
               size = 1) 
    
```
